		<h2>Design Process</h2>
		<br>
		<p>When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height,
			balance,
			drive train,
			sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. We also strive to design and
			build a base
			robot
			which is robust and which features a frame around the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as
			means to
			square
			up against walls and mission models.
			<!--Before creating a prototype base robot, we prepare some high level rudimentary drawings on a flip chart
	which we use to stimulate discussion amongst team members. Once the team settles on a high-level base robot design, we use LDD
	or ML CAD to create a 3D-drawing of the prototype. Doing so allows us to be as efficient as possible with regard to type and quantity
	of pieces used. Based on the final drawing, we construct our prototype base robot using LEGO pieces/elements. After creating a working
	prototype,-->We
			design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be easy to install and remove, robust, and
			both
			passive
			and multi-purpose whenever possible. From testing the prototype base robot and the attachments, we make
			revisions to
			our
			work in order to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve maximum efficiency. By
			the end
			of
			the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.</p>

		<p>
			Our robot is very robust and compact with a frame for strength. We use four light sensors for maximum
			flexibility,
			with shielding from ambient light. Our robot has small wheels, which are steering neutral, and has narrow
			and hard wheels
			for more accuracy and both straight movements and turns. However, we sacrifice some speed due to our small
			diameter wheels
			which decrease the error associated with the drive motor rotation sensors.

		<h2>Examples of Robotic Testing Conducted by Ctrl-Z </h2>
		<br>
		<h4>Finding the Optimal Set of Color Sensors for our Robot</h4>
		<p>When first designing our robot we wanted to make sure that all the light/color sensors behaved similarly.
			Color
			sensors each return small differences in readings because of variations in manufacturing. For example, if
			you were to place
			two different color sensors on the same black line, each would return different values for light intensity.
			Sometimes
			the difference may be significant. To make sure that all our light sensors had about the same reading we
			completely
			shielded ten color sensors to eliminate the variable of ambient light and recorded the reading for each of
			the color sensors
			on black, white, and green. We then found the three color sensors which have the closest reading to each
			other and used
			those three color sensors on the robot.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Making the Robot Drive Straight</h4>
		<p>We have found that the green EV3 move blocks (Move Tank and Move Steering) are unreliable. Although they have
			a
			built in PID feature, they still do not move the robot in a straight line. To test this, we set a designated
			starting spot
			for the robot and then we ran it until it hit the wall on the other side of the table. We repeated this
			dozens of times
			and found that each time it would end up in a different spot on the other side of the table. Each time it
			would be up to
			one inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error-corrected move block (which you can read
			about in the
			programming section of this website). We conducted the same experiment using our block and found that there
			was much less error
			and the robot would consistently end up in the same position on the table.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Light Sensor Distance Experiment</h4>
		<p>Our light sensors were dependent on the distance they were away from the mat. We found out that our light
			sensors
			were too low to the mat and were not picking up proper light readings. We used the EV3 experiment which can
			track the
			different movements on the motors and sensors. We tracked the readings to see if they would change properly
			from white to
			black; 100 to 0. They did not reach those values so we realized it was too far from the mat.

						This attachment completes the Core Samples extraction mission. It connects to the robotâ€™s medium

						while the attachment
						slides along the top of the mission model and traps the core samples within the borders of the

					<td class="tick-border">Tela-Velocity</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This attachment completes the Escape Velocity and Telescope missions. The robot pushes the
						attachment against the
						wall using guide wheels that are attached to the frame. The robot stops abruptly causing the
						attachment to jerk forward,
						dropping its heavy wheel on the launch pad on the Escape Velocity mission model then extends the
						arm using elastics. As
						the robot begins to drive forward, the arm pushes the pointer on the Telescope mission.</td>

					<td class="tick-border">Water Core Sample</td>

						the Cone Module, and delivers
						it back to base.

					<td class="tick-border">Crater Crossing</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This attachment pushes down the gate on the Crater Crossing mission model. The attachment
						connects to the robotâ€™s front large

					<td class="tick-border">Satellites</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
						This attachment is connected on top of the robot. Part of this attachment shoots our agent craft

						This attachment is used to put Gerhard completely into the Habitation Hub's Airlock Chamber for

						This attachment is connected to the back-medium motor. We have added a lock to connect the
						attachment to the robot incase the attachment
						comes off mid-way through the mission. There are guide wheels connected to the side frame of the
						attachment to drive along the west wall.
						Once the robot reaches the Space Travel ramp, it continues to drive as a wedge lifts the lever
						on the mission model, letting the first
						payload roll down the ramp. Next, an arm on the attachment pushes the solar panel forward, as
						the robot continues driving. Once the robot
						reaches the mission model and cannot further drive, an arm with the other two payloads is then
						lowered, and the payloads get loaded onto the
						ramp. The payloads are loosely attached to the attachment, so when the robot then drives back to
						base the payloads are released and roll down
						the ramp. </td>

					<td class="tick-border">Sol-Arm</td>
					<td class="tick-border">
