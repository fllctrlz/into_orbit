		<h2>Design Process</h2>
		<br>
		<p>When designing our base robot, we establish criteria at the outset, such as desired footprint, height, balance, drive train,
			sensors to be used, user interface, etc. to arrive at a working prototype. We also strive to design and build a base robot
			which is robust and which features a frame around the chassis to provide structural rigidity as well as means to square
			up against walls and mission models.
			<!--Before creating a prototype base robot, we prepare some high level rudimentary drawings on a flip chart
	which we use to stimulate discussion amongst team members. Once the team settles on a high-level base robot design, we use LDD
	or ML CAD to create a 3D-drawing of the prototype. Doing so allows us to be as efficient as possible with regard to type and quantity
	of pieces used. Based on the final drawing, we construct our prototype base robot using LEGO pieces/elements. After creating a working
	prototype,-->We design attachments keeping in mind that these attachments need to be easy to install and remove, robust, and both passive
			and multi-purpose whenever possible. From testing the prototype base robot and the attachments, we make revisions to our
			work in order to combine and speed up missions and increase repeatability to achieve maximum efficiency. By the end of
			the season, our attachments will often be in their fifth or sixth iteration.</p>

		<h2>Examples of Robotic Testing Conducted by Ctrl-Z </h2>
		<br>
		<h4>Finding the Optimal Set of Color Sensors for our Robot</h4>
		<p>When first designing our robot we wanted to make sure that all the light/color sensors behaved similarly. Color sensors
			each return small differences in readings because of variations in manufacturing. For example, if you were to place two
			different color sensors on the same black line, each would return different values for light intensity. Sometimes the
			difference may be significant. To make sure that all our light sensors had about the same reading we completely shielded
			ten color sensors to eliminate the variable of ambient light and recorded the reading for each of the color sensors on
			black, white, and green. We then found the three color sensors which have the closest reading to each other and used those
			three color sensors on the robot.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Making the Robot Drive Straight</h4>
		<p>We have found the the green EV3 move blocks (Move Tank and Move Steering) are unreliable. Although they have a built in
			PID feature, they still do not move the robot in a straight line. To test this, we set a designated starting spot for
			the robot and then we ran it until it hit the wall on the other side of the table. We repeated this dozens of times and
			found that each time it would end up in a different spot on the other side of the table. Each time it would be up to one
			inch away from the previous run. Then, we made our own error-corrected move block (which you can read about in the programming
			section of this website). We conducted the same experiment using our block and found that there was much less error and
			the robot would consistently end up in the same position on the table.
		</p>
		<br>
		<h4>Light Sensor Distance Experiment</h4>
		<p>Our light sensors were dependent on the distance they were away from the mat. We found out that our light sensors were
			too low to the mat and were not picking up proper light readings. We used the EV3 experiment which can track the different
			movements on the motors and sensors. We tracked the readings to see if they would change properly from white to black;
			100 to 0. They did not reach those values so we realized it was too far from the mat.
		</p>

		<br>
		<br>

		<p>
			Our base robot is very robust and compact with a frame for strength. We also use four light sensors and for maximum flexibility,
			with shielding from ambient light. The robot’s main drive wheels are medium in diameter and small in thickness to allow
			us to balance accuracy and speed together. The robot uses small wheels without rubber on them as sliders, to be steering
			neutral. Our modular design and attachment bay allows the robot driver to install and remove attachments quickly and accurately,
			while our brain’s positioning allows for easy swapping of batteries.

						This attachment is a large frame with guide wheels to move along the west wall. It has a long horizontally-moving arm that
						uses string and a pulley system to move which connects to the gears on the robot when the frame is placed over the
						robot. As the robot moves along the west wall towards the Space Travel mission using its guide wheels, the arm extends
						eastward to trigger an elastic mechanism to collect all core samples. The arm then retracts. When the robot reaches
						the Space Travel mission, it uses a wedge to passively lift the end of the ramp resulting in the Vehicle Payload rolling
						down the ramp. While doing this, an arm on the end of the attachment pushes the Solar Panel Array away from our competition
						table. The robot then drives into the ramp releasing the other two payloads and allowing them to roll down the ramp.
						The robot then travels back to base.

				An arm falls onto the flower’s base, pressing against the ground while also pushing the water into

				A one-way latch on the same arm lowers and picks up the broken pipe. The robot drives to the 
				Pipe Construction zone and lifts the main arm along with a gate, allowing the robot to simply 
				drive away and deposit the new pipe without an optional loop.  Two axles on the other side of 
				the robot lower and drop a new pipe with an optional loop into the Pipe Replacement target.  
				The robot drives towards the nearest Manhole Cover and flips it by pushing it into the barrier
				behind it with an axle.  On the way back to base, the robot flips the second Manhole Cover 
				using the same method.

						This attachment is a small frame with guide wheels that goes around the robot with a seperate sliding portion. The robot
						moves eastward along the south wall using its guide wheels. Once the sliding portion of the attachment reaches the
						Space Station Modules Mission Model, angled beams on it act as a funnel and force it to slide outwards. As the robot
						continues forward, the Tube Module is inserted into the east side of the mission model and an elastic mechanism is
						triggered to remove the Dock Module, which is dropped into a basket on the attachment. At the same time, the robot
						senses the black line just before the Escape Velocity mission model and activates an elastic powered arm to complete
						the Escape Velocity mission. Once the robot has travelled far enough, a system of gears used to move the arm used to
						move the Observatory arm pushes the arm far enough that it drops, falling over the Escape Velocity mission model. As
						the robot keeps moving, the arm pushes the Observatory's arm into the orange target area. The robot moves back to base,
						leaving the arm for the Observatory behind and taking the Dock Module back to base.</td>

						following until a different light sensor sees the parallel black line just south of Food Production. The robot then
						moves the push bar until in a scoring position. The robot then navigates to the satellite scoring area, resulting in
						the two satellites on the back robot, to be in scoring position
