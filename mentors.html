					<td class="tick-border">

						Vlad Ionescu, Grade 5 and 7 Visual Art teahcer at Bayview Glen, has worked in various industries totally unrelated to education, 
						such as real estate and recruitment,
						he always kept art as a passion which he pursued professionally and taught in his free time. He soon realized that seeing
						students finally grasp a difficult concept or complete a piece they’ve been working on for weeks is one of the most
						satisfying and rewarding experiences. When he finally decided to take on teaching as a profession, he ran ahead full
						speed and never looked back. Throughout his teaching career he has taught internationally, in the public school system,
						in the International Baccalaureate programme, and at an alternative school, all of which have given him different perspectives
						and challenges. While his experience, for the most part, has been teaching Art, Philosophy, ESL, and French, teaching
						in the Bayview Glen Prep School (and virtually every subject therein) has proven to be a lot of fun. When he is not teaching at
						Bayview Glen, he is teaching adult life drawing and painting classes, riding his motorcycle through the backwoods of
						Canada, rock climbing, attempting to do yoga and reading.

					<td class="tick-border">Alex is currently one of the youth coaches of the FLL robotics team, Ctrl-Z Bayview Glen. Prior to holding this position,
						he was a member of the Ctrl-Z team for 6 years. During his time on Ctrl-Z, he had the opportunity to compete in 2 FIRST
						Championships in St. Louis, the International Open in Toronto, the North American Open Championship in Arkansas, and
						the North American Open Championship in San Diego, California. Being in FLL has taught Alex to better public speak
						and to teach students more effectively which he hopes to apply to help Ctrl-Z succeed this season. Outside of robotics,
						he likes to play Ultimate Frisbee, Ski, and bike with his friends
