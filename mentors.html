			In her spare time, she loves to read, bake, and spend time exploring Toronto with her family and friends.

			 youth coaches of the FLL robotics team,
             Ctrl-Z Bayview Glen.  Prior to holding this position, he was a member of the Ctrl-Z
             team for 4 years.  During his time on Ctrl-Z, he had the opportunity to compete in 2 FIRST
             Championships in St. Louis, the International Open in Toronto, and the North American Open Championship
             in San Diego, California.  Being in FLL has taught Alex to better public speak and to teach
             students more effectively which he hopes to apply to help Ctrl-Z succeed this season.  Outside
             of robotics, he likes to play badminton, Scrabble, bike with his friends and play with LEGO.

			Christopher is one of the enthusiastic coaches of Ctrl-Z. Before this season, he was a Ctrl-Z team member for four extraordinary seasons: Food Factor,
			Senior Solutions, Natureâ€™s Fury, and World Class. As part of the team, he has learned to better manage his time, collaborate with others, and effectively
			share ideas with others. He looks forward to promoting FLL, spreading his knowledge to the new team members, and helping the team on its journey from 
			start to finish. Outside of robotics, he enjoys reading, building with LEGO, and studying.
