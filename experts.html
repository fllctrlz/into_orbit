Water Brothers Host,<br>Water Brothers

<br>
             <td class="tick-border">
				The idea to embark on The Water Brothers project first arose in 2009, when Alex started working alongside his brother at SK Films, 
				conducting research for IMAX ® films in development. After receiving a degree in International Development and Environmental Studies from 
				Dalhousie, the decision to join the family business and begin the Water Brothers series was an easy one. The series has allowed him to combine 
				his interest in science, the environment and film to explain how humans can harmonize our relationship with water and the natural world. 
				When he isn’t working on the Water Brothers, he likes to spend his time reading, playing sports, scuba diving and hanging out with friends at 
				the family’s Georgian Bay cottage.
