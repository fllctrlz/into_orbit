							As I grew up, the one certainty in my life was that I wanted to do something with Astronomy. It was easy to go through high
							school and University because I was always sure of what I wanted to do. Once I finished my Masters degree in Astronomy
							I knew that research was not the route I wanted to take. Before I started my masters I had the opportunity to perform
							a travelling Science show with the McMaster University department of Engineering called the FIreball show. I quickly
							discovered a passion for travelling around and entertaining students with the fun side of science. Once my contract
							ended I knew I had to spend my life doing something similar. I knew that I loved talking to people, teaching, working
							with kids, and educating the public when it came to Astronomy, but I had to find a way to do it that was exactly what
							I wanted, especially if I was setting myself up to do it for the next 30 years.
