						I develop efficient systems and infrastructure for space flight, and direct the Communications and Operations Laboratory. My research interests centre on nanosatellite technology development. Nanosatellites are, in general, spacecraft with a mass less than 10 kg. They have been increasingly recognized as valuable tools for demonstrating new technologies in space as well as an effective means to educate space engineering professionals due to their relatively low cost. My focus has been to develop a series of space technologies that will lead to scientific nanosatellite missions in the near future. Currently, I am investigating several areas including micro- propulsion system design, MEMS-based attitude sensor and actuator design and algorithms to incorporate their low-grade characteristics, and subsystems based upon field-programmable gate arrays. I am a Canadian participant for the QB50 Mission to develop nanosatellites for an Earth Observation experiment.
I have a passion to engage youth from non-science, non-academic backgrounds, and young women in particular, to discover their potential through scientific problem solving and in turn enrich the diversity of 
ideas and perspectives within the engineering field. To this end, I am a part of many progressive initiatives, including Space Junk, a youth-at-risk workshop with Big Brothers Big Sisters of Toronto, 
and Go Eng Girl, introducing girls in secondary school to engineering. Also, I initiated and subsequently guided the York University Rover Team, which has won major international awards each year since 2007.

							As I grew up, the one certainty in my life was that I wanted to do something with Astronomy. It was easy to go through high
							school and University because I was always sure of what I wanted to do. Once I finished my Masters degree in Astronomy
							I knew that research was not the route I wanted to take. Before I started my masters I had the opportunity to perform
							a travelling Science show with the McMaster University department of Engineering called the FIreball show. I quickly
							discovered a passion for travelling around and entertaining students with the fun side of science. Once my contract
							ended I knew I had to spend my life doing something similar. I knew that I loved talking to people, teaching, working
							with kids, and educating the public when it came to Astronomy, but I had to find a way to do it that was exactly what
							I wanted, especially if I was setting myself up to do it for the next 30 years.
