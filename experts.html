				As I grew up, the one certainty in my life was that I wanted to do something with Astronomy.  It was easy to go through high school and University because I was always sure of what I wanted to do.  Once I finished my Masters degree in Astronomy I knew that research was not the route I wanted to take.
Before I started my masters I had the opportunity to perform a travelling Science show with the McMaster University department of Engineering called the FIreball show.  I quickly discovered a passion for travelling around and entertaining students with the fun side of science.  Once my contract ended I knew I had to spend my life doing something similar.
I knew that I loved talking to people, teaching, working with kids, and educating the public when it came to Astronomy, but I had to find a way to do it that was exactly what I wanted, especially if I was setting myself up to do it for the next 30 years.

             <td class="tick-border">
				The idea to embark on The Water Brothers project first arose in 2009, when Alex started working alongside his brother at SK Films, 
				conducting research for IMAX ® films in development. After receiving a degree in International Development and Environmental Studies from 
				Dalhousie, the decision to join the family business and begin the Water Brothers series was an easy one. The series has allowed him to combine 
				his interest in science, the environment and film to explain how humans can harmonize our relationship with water and the natural world. 
				When he isn’t working on the Water Brothers, he likes to spend his time reading, playing sports, scuba diving and hanging out with friends at 
				the family’s Georgian Bay cottage.
